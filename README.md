The calculator interface mirrors an ordinary calculator. The calculations are done on the server, and stored there until the user clears the inputs.

## Usage

1. Clicking on calculator buttons inputs the number or the operation clicked. 

2. The calculator will also prevent clicking on multiple operators (+ - * /) in a row. 

3. The input is displayed above the calculator keys as they are clicked.

4. If the user doesn't click on any inputs and then clicks "equals", the calculator will show an alert asking for inputs.

5. Clicking on "C" button will clear the inputs.

6. Clicking on "Delete history" button will delete the previous calculations.
